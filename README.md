# Java Learning Mini Projects ☕🚀

This repository contains all the **mini projects** I built while learning **Java**.  
Each project focuses on understanding core Java concepts, especially **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, through hands-on practice.

This repo is not about complex or production-level applications —  
it represents my **learning journey**, consistency, and gradual improvement in Java.
