# Java Learning Mini Projects ☕🚀

This repository contains all the **mini projects** I’ve built while learning **Java**.  
Each project focuses on understanding **core Java concepts**, especially **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, through hands-on practice.

This repository is **not about production-level applications**.  
It represents my **learning journey**, consistency, and gradual improvement in Java fundamentals.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- Beginner-friendly Java mini projects
- Clean and readable code
- Focus on logic, structure, and OOP fundamentals
- Projects built step by step while learning Java

Each project folder contains:
- Source code
- A short README explaining the project idea and concepts used
