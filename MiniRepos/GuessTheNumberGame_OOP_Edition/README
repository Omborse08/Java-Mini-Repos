# Guess The Number Game 🎯 (Java OOP)

This is a simple **Guess The Number** console game built using **Java** and basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The goal of this project is to practice clean OOP structure while keeping the logic simple and beginner-friendly.

## 🚀 About the Project

- The program generates a random number.
- The user keeps guessing the number.
- After every guess, the program tells whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
- At the end, the total number of guesses is displayed.

This project was built as part of Java OOP practice and focuses more on **concept clarity** than complexity.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors  
- Encapsulation (private variables + getters/setters)  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Random number generation  
- User input using `Scanner`

## 🕹 How the Game Works

1. A random number is generated when the game starts.
2. The user enters a number.
3. The program gives feedback:
   - **Too High**
   - **Too Low**
4. The game repeats until the correct number is guessed.
5. Once guessed correctly, the program displays:
   - A win message
   - Total number of guesses taken
